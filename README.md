### 👋 Hi, I'm Sam Kavanagh
I'm a web developer currently working as a technical lead at the Centre for eResearch. I have a **PhD in Computer Science** but my real passion is **front-end web development**.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: leading the migration of an Angular project to AWS (and to GraphQL and Contentful).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: how to write GraphQL integration tests when using remote schemas
- 📫 How to reach me: [tofu.dev/contact](https://tofu.dev/contact)

### 🚀 Projects I'm Actively Developing
- 🎨 [ResearchHub Web](https://github.com/UoA-eResearch/hub-stack/tree/master/research-hub-web): An Angular project deployed to AWS S3/CloudFront and using Cognito for authentication.
- 🛡 [CeR GraphQL](https://github.com/UoA-eResearch/hub-stack/tree/master/cer-graphql): An Apollo GraphQL server. Extends a remote GraphQL schema. Docker, AWS ECR/Fargate.
- 📩 [Serverless Now](https://github.com/UoA-eResearch/hub-stack/tree/master/serverless-now): A Node server that generates tickets and sends them to ServiceNow.  Lambda function on AWS.
- 🤖 [Monorepo DevOps](https://github.com/UoA-eResearch/hub-stack/blob/master/Jenkinsfile): A CI/CD Jenkins job I am creating to conditionally build/test/deploy multiple AWS services.
